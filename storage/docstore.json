so\naddictive?[6]Octalysis\nThe Octalysis Framework is a human-focused gamification design framework that lays out the eight core\ndrives for humans motivation developed by Yu-Kai Chou.[1] The framework is based on the premise that\nsystems are \u201cfunction-focused\u201d, designed to complete a task as quickly as possible, similar to a factory\nprocess assuming workers will complete their tasks in a timely manner because they are required to do so.\nHowever, human-focused design acknow ledges that people, unlike machines in a system have feelings,\ninsecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore, optimizes for\ntheir feelings, motivations, and engagement.\nThe framework lays out the structure for analysing the driving forces behind human motivation. It is the\nprocess of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an\ninteractive experience.[2] The Octalysis framework is used in healthcare, fitness, education, training,\ncompany, and produc t design to increase user engagement, ROI and motivation.[3][4][5]\nThe Octalysis framework sugge sts that if there are no core drives present,\nthen there is no motivation and no behavior will happen. This is based on\nthe premise that almost all games appeal to certain core drives within us and\nmotivate us towards a variety of decisions and activities. The framework\ndivides these motivations into eight core drives.\nThis Core Drive is in play when a person believes he or she is\ndoing something greater than oneself or was \u201cchosen\u201d to take\naction. An example would be Wikipedia volunteers who maintain\nthe page and contribute to the development of its content.\nContributors do not receive any extrinsic reward, but they feel that\ntheir contribution will help to develop and protect human\nknow ledge. The implementation of this drive can vastly differ, and\nis not limited to altruistic behavior. Some of the world's worst\nevents and actions have happened with the belief of participating in\nsomething gr eater than one self.Eight Core Drives\nCore Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling\nCore Drive 2: Development and\nAccomplishment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57d151d0-69db-42ad-a266-b9366227f330": {"__data__": {"id_": "57d151d0-69db-42ad-a266-b9366227f330", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "147f6c07-865e-4e29-9180-5ead60446942", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-01"}, "hash": "51cdf73c6f4884c04b267599a39d903aab5f4e83a330dd5695f13122b657d795"}}, "hash": "51cdf73c6f4884c04b267599a39d903aab5f4e83a330dd5695f13122b657d795", "text": "This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth towards a goal and accomplishing it.\nWin-State is often a scenario in which user has overcome a challenge. The perception of the challenge is\nimportant. For example, a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful for a person. This is the\ndrive that most PBLs: Points, Badges, and Leaderboards focus on.\nThis drive is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new\nthings out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but also\nneed to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with\nLegos, playing Minecraft, and making art are intrinsically fun. When properly designed and integrated to\nempower users to be creative; they often become Evergreen Mechanics: a game designer no longe r needs\nto continuous ly add content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. T he brain simply entertains itself.\nThis drive refers to users feeling like they own or control something. When a person feels ownership over\nsomething, they innately want to increase and improve what they own. For example, the human desire to\naccumulate wealth and the overvaluing of objects within one's possession are the result of this drive. People\nmight think their hous e is worth far more than the market is willing to pay for it, not because of any intrinsic\nproperty of the hous e but because they personally ow n it.\nThis drive incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: mentorship, social\nacceptance, companionship, and even competition and envy. When you s ee a friend that is amazing at some\nskill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to attain the same. Think about how we\nnaturally draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to, turning into a spot premium\nmotivator.\nScarcity and impatience is the core drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare,\nexclusive, or immediately unattainable. Many games have Appointment dyna mics or torture breaks within\nthem (come back in 2 hours to get your reward). The fact that people can\u2019t get something right now\nmotivates them to return to check the availability of the produc t.[7]\nUnpredictability is the core drive of constantly being engaged because you don't know  what is going to\nhappen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks\ninto high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary core drive behind gamblingCore Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback\nCore Drive 4: Ownership and Possession\nCore Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness\nCore Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience\nCore Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30041649-a772-447a-92e0-c4ee6d22f532": {"__data__": {"id_": "30041649-a772-447a-92e0-c4ee6d22f532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "318c62ac-ae93-4019-a5da-3780bfe0089e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-01"}, "hash": "27308bdb5901ff51d0c2e758d250cd683fdcbae1aaa48888f536942ab3868104"}}, "hash": "27308bdb5901ff51d0c2e758d250cd683fdcbae1aaa48888f536942ab3868104", "text": "addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the\ncontroversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal presses a lever more frequently when rewards are\nunpredictable than when rewards occur at fixed times.\nLoss and avoidance is the core drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a\nsmall scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behavior. On a larger scale, it could\nbe to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting.\nOpportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this core drive, because people feel if they\ndidn't act immediately, they would lose the oppor tunity to act forever. This is commonly know n as fear of\nmissing out and can often be seen in marketing promotions with limited time periods, or speculative\ninvestments where any de lay may lead to missing out  on a  once-in-a-lifetime oppor tunity.\nEverything we do is based on one or more of the eight core drives. If none  of them is present, there is zero\nmotivation and no action takes place. Additionally, each of these drives have different natures within them.\nSome make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency. Others core drives create urgency, obsession,\nand even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some\nare more long-term intrinsically focused.\nAs a result, the 8 core drives are charted on an octagon not simply for aesthetic purposes, but because the\nplacement determines the nature of the motivation.\nThe left side of the Octalysis chart is commonly associated with logic, analytical thought , and ownership.\nPeople are motivated by extrinsic elements such as rewards, money, goals, milestones, points, badges,\nrecognition. However, once people obtain the goal or get used to it, they no longe r take the desired\nbehavior.\nThe right side of the Octalysis chart relies on intrinsic motivation: creativity, self-expression and social\ndyna mics. You don't need a goal or reward to use your creativity, hangout  with friends, or to feel the\nsuspense of unpredictability. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic core drives is an important task; research\nshows that extrinsic motivation impairs intrinsic motivation. Because once the companies stop offering the\nextrinsic motivator, user motivation will often plummet to a level much lower than when the extrinsic\nmotivator was first introduc ed (the Over-justification Effect).\nKeep in mind that left brain and right brain references are not literal in terms of actual brain geography, but\nmerely a symbolic differentiation be tween two distinct functions of the brain.\nWhite Hat core drives make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. On the Octalysis octagon they are\nrepresented on the top. It involves motivations that engage the user on expressing creativity and\nachievement through mastering of skills, resulting in a higher sense of accomplishments, meaning, and\nempowerment.

If you are always doing something because you don't know  what will\nhappen next, you are constantly in fear of losing something, or because you're struggling to attain things\nyou can't have, the experience will often leave a bad taste in your mouth \u2013 even if you are consistently\nmotivated to take these actions.\nThe White Hat core drives are represented by t he core drives at the top of  the Octalysis diagram:\nCore Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling\nCore Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment\nCore Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback\nThe Black Hat core drives are represented by t he core drives at the bottom of the Octalysis diagram:\nCore Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience\nCore Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity\nCore Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance\nEach Core Drive has many game techniques associated with it. For example, Boosters \u2013 or items that\nempower Desired Actions \u2013 are a game technique of Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and\nFeedback. These techniques are num bered and can be found i n bot h the blog and the book.\nUsing the Octalysis framework, Magnum created a digital online game that resembles the Super Mario\ngame.
