The PDPA contains two (2) main sets of provisions, covering data \nprotection and the Do Not Call registry, which organisations are required to comply \nwith.   \n The PDP A\u2019s data protection obligations are set out in Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA (the \n\u201cData Protection Provisions\u201d). In brief, the Data Protection Provisions deal with the \nfollowing matters:  \na) Having reasonable purposes, notify ing purposes and obtaining consent for  \nthe collection, use or disclosure of personal data;  \nb) Allowing individuals to access and correct their personal data;  \nc) Taking care of personal data (which relates to ensuring accuracy), protecting \npersonal data (includin g protection in the case of internatio nal transfers) \nand not retaining personal data if no longer needed;  \nd) Notifying the Commission  and affected individuals of data breaches; and \ne) Having policies and practices to comply with the PDPA.  \n The PDPA provides a nu mber of exceptions to various Data Pro tection Provisions to \naddress situations where organisations may have a legitimate need, for example, to \ncollect, use or disclose personal data without consent or to refuse to provide an \nindividual with access to his p ersonal data.  \n The PDPA\u2019s Do Not Call R egistry provisions are set out in Part s 9 and 9A of the PDPA \n(the \u201cDo Not Call Provisions\u201d). These deal with the establishment of Singapore\u2019s \nnational Do Not Call Registry (the \u201cDo Not Call Registry\u201d) and the obligatio ns of \norganisations relating to the se nding of certain marketing messages to Singapore \ntelephone numbers. The Do Not Call Registry comprise s three (3) separate registers \nkept and maintained by the Commission under section 39 of the PDPA (the \u201cDo Not \nCall R egisters\u201d) which cover telephone calls , text messages and faxes. Users and \nsubscribers may register their Singapore telephone number(s) on one or more Do \nNot Call Registers depending on their preferences in relation to receiving marketing \nmessages through telephone calls, text messages or faxe s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1ae3c4b-1084-4d43-bcde-3a0360c8a357": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1ae3c4b-1084-4d43-bcde-3a0360c8a357", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfc863b0-e368-49bd-98e1-b1786e2638d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "c524ce227a1cee6d8ef3027fd5b51c512a391e24f8fc3db415ab637be234c3e6"}}, "hash": "fd8d6a2c11aa2f8b4426a278ca4beb17564e5cc250692df95303aa9ac02342c0", "text": "9 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n Organisations have the following obligations in relation to sending certain marketing \nmessages to Singapore telephone numbers:  \na) Checking the relevant Do Not Call Register(s) to confirm if the Singapore \ntelephone number is listed on the Do Not Call Re gister(s);  \nb) Providing information on the individual or organisation who sent or \nauthorised the sending of the marketing message; and  \nc) Not concealing or withholding the calling line identity of the sender of the \nmarketing  message.  \n The PDPA recognises that org anisations may not need to check the Do Not Call \nRegisters in certain circumstances, in particular, when the user or subscriber of a \nSingapore telephone number has given clear and unambiguous consent in written or \nothe r accessible form to the sending of th e marketing message to that number. In \naddition, certain organisations that are in an ongoing relationship with individuals \nwould  not need  to check the Do Not Call Registry before sending certain messages \nrelated to th e subject of the ongoing relationship.  \n Further, organisations are prohibited from sending any messages to any telephone \nnumber that is generated or obtained through the use of address -harvesting \nsoftware , or to use dictionary attacks or similar automated m eans to send messages \nindiscriminately . Please refer to the Advisory Guidelines on the Do Not Call Provisions \nfor more information.  \n The Data Protection Provisions and the Do Not Call Provisions are intended to \noperate in conjunction. Accordingly, organisa tions are required to comply with both \nsets of provisions when collecting and using Singapore telephone numbers that form \npart of ind ividuals\u2019 personal data. Organisations need not comply with the Data \nProtection Provisions for Singapore telephone numbers that do not form part of an \nindividual\u2019s personal data but  would still be required to comply with the Do Not Call \nProvisions.   \n Part 9B of the PDPA sets out o ffences that hold  individuals accountable for egregious \nmishandling of personal data . The offences are for knowing or reckless unauthorised \n(a) disclosure of personal data; (b) use of personal data for a wrongful gain or a \nwrongful loss to any person; and (c) re -identification of anonymised data . \n Other parts of the PDPA (which are not specifically addre ssed in these Guidelines) \ndeal with the administration of the PDPA and certain preliminary and general \nmatters.

This may be distinguished from \njuridical persons or \u201clegal persons\u201d which are other entities that have their own legal \npersonality and are capable of taking legal action in their own name. An example of \nsuch a \u201clegal person\u201d is a body corpo rate such as a company. The term \u201cnatural \nperson\u201d would also exclude unincorporated groups of individuals such as an \nassociation which may take legal action in its own name1. \n Accordingly, since the various Data Protectio n Provisions are concerned with the \npersonal data of individuals, only the personal data of natural persons is protected \nunder the PDPA. Data relating to corporate bodies and other entities are not \ncovered.  \n As the term \u201cindividual\u201d includes both living an d deceased individuals, the PDPA \napplies in respect of deceased individuals. However, as will be explained later, the \nPDPA applies to a limited extent in respect of the personal data of deceased \nindividuals.  \n  \n \n1 For example, a society registered under the Societies Act (Cap. 311) may sue or be sued in its registered name \n(Societies Act,  section 35).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a262db0c-b20d-472c-9f47-8e9f463ffc0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a262db0c-b20d-472c-9f47-8e9f463ffc0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f042a349-3946-4c52-8047-f30f502c7e6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "c336ef840e8e2400130a060d61d6abcf6032c78396ba82c2bf8ea483c5f395c1"}}, "hash": "c01988aae94273bbce2f4cb56384d36f33fd5aa1b00567510d89786dc62e749b", "text": "12 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n Personal data  \n Personal data is defined in th e PDPA as \u201cdata, whether true or not , about an \nindividual who can be identified \u2014 \na) from that data; or  \nb) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is \nlikely to have access\u201d.  \n The term \u201cpersonal data\u201d is not intended to be narrowly co nstrued and may cover \ndifferent type s of data about an individual and from which an individual can be \nidentified, regardless of whether such data is true or accurate,  or whether the data \nexists in electronic or other form.   \n The PDPA does not apply in rela tion to certain categories of person al data which are \nexpressly excluded from the application of the PDPA. These are highlighted in the \nsections later.  Please also refer to the chapter on \u201cAnonymisation\u201d in the Advisory \nGuidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, which describes the consider ations and \nconditions under which personal data may be anonymised and no longer considered \npersonal data for the purposes of the PDPA.  \nWhen is data considered \u201cpersonal data\u201d?  \n The most basic requirement for data to cons titute personal data is that it is \ninformation  about an identifiable  individual.  There are two principal considerations. \nFirst, is the purpose  of information to be data about an individual or which relates to \nthe individual. Examples  include information about an individual\u2019s health, \neducatio nal and employment background, as well as an individual\u2019s activities such as \nspending patterns. There will be situations where the personal data is incidental to \nthe purpose of the information . For  example , an internal investigations report that \nincidental ly includes names and appointme nts of  key actors involved in the incident \nunder investigations. The content of individuals\u2019 c ommunications, such as email \nmessages and text messages, in and of thems elves will generally not be considered \npersonal data, unles s they contain information about an individual that can identify \nthe individual.   \n Second, the individual should be identifiable  from the data.

For example, a mailing list of email addresses may not be \npersonal data on  its own, but if the list contains customer IDs that can be linked to \nrecords in the Customer Relationship Management (\u201c CRM \u201d) system, then the list \nmay be considered personal data.  \n A practical approach is to first identify the set of information  under consideration  \n(e.g. information recorded in documents and stored in files, o r stored in electronic \ndatabases or IT systems ). Next, organisations should a pply the analysis in the \npreceding paragraphs and ask : (a) is the purpose of this set of informa tion about \nindividuals ; and (b) can individuals be identified from this set of info rmation or other \ninformation they  have access to.  In general, organisations should avoid making \nassess ments in the abstract . The following paragraphs set out a few of the \nCommission\u2019s considerations in determining personal data.  \nNumber of data elements in  the dataset and availability of other information  \n The rule of thumb is that there should be at least two data elements in the dataset \nbefore individuals can be identified . Sometimes, more than two data elements may \nbe required before an individual can be identified. This depends very much on the \nspecifici ty and nature of the data elements. For example, the combination of name \nand NRIC number is usually sufficient to identify individuals, but email addresses may \nneed to be combined with customer shopping pr eferences and purchase history \nbefore individuals c an be identified from this combination of data elements.  In \ndetermining whether the dataset is personal data , an organisation should not \noverlook the availability of other information it has or is likely t o have access to.  For \nexample, a unique customer ID  that can link a mailing list to the CRM system.   \n In general, the Commission will apply a \u201cpracticability\u201d threshold in determining \nwhether an organisation is likely to have access to other data that will identify an \nindividual. As such, an organisation wi ll not be considered to have access to other \ninformation if it is not practicable (e.g. where it requires huge costs, time, resources) \neven though it is theoretically or technically possible for the organi sation to gain \naccess to such information.  \nNature  of data  \n Certain types of data , by their nature or use,  are more likely to  identify an individual . \nThis includes data that has been assigned exclusively to an individual for the \npurposes of identifying the individual (e.g. NRIC or passport number of an ind ividual) , \nor data of a bio logical  nature (e.g. DNA, facial image, fingerprint, iris prints) . In \ngeneral, fewer  data elements are required for a dataset to constitute personal data  \nif it contains data points  or data elements  that are more unique to an indiv idual .

As will be seen later, a number of the \nData Protection Provisions refer to the purposes for which an organisation collects, \nuses or discloses personal data . For example, an organisation is required to  notify \nindividuals of the purposes for which it is collecting, using or disclosing personal data \n(referred to later as the \u201cNotification Obligation\u201d). Hence in order to notify such \npurposes, an organisation wou ld need to determine what its purposes are.  \n The term \u201cpurpose\u201d does not refer to activities which an organisation may intend to \nundertake but rather to its objectives or reasons.

For example, section 11(1) states that an organisation must , in \nmeeting its responsibilities under the PDPA , consider what a reasonable person \nwould consider appropriate in the circum stances. Other Data Protection Provisions \nsimilarly make reference to something or some set of circumstances which is \nreasonable.  \n Section 11(1) does not impose a separate obligatio n on organisations but requires \nthem to consider \u201cwhat a reasonable person w ould consider appropriate in the \ncircumstances\u201d when they undertake any action that is subject to the Data \nProtection Provisions. In seeking to comply with the Data Protection Prov isions, \norganisations should therefore act based on what a reasonable person  would \nconsider appropriate in the circumstances.   \n The PDPA recognises that a balance needs to be struck between the need to protect \nindividuals\u2019 personal data and the need of org anisations to collect, use or disclose \npersonal data. The PDPA seeks to prov ide such a balance by allowing organisations \nto collect, use and disclose personal data for purposes which a reasonable person \nwould consider appropriate in the circumstances and s imilarly requires organisations \nto act based on this standard of reasonablen ess. \n In determining what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the \ncircumstances, an organisation should consider the particular circumstance it is \nfacing. Taking those  circumstances into consideration, the organisation should \ndetermine what wo uld be the appropriate course of action to take in order to comply \nwith its obligations under the PDPA based on what a reasonable person would \nconsider appropriate.  \n A \u201creasonable p erson\u201d is judged based on an objective standard and can be said to \nbe a pers on who exercises the appropriate care and  judgement  in the particular \ncircumstance.  The Commission notes that the standard of reasonableness is \nexpected to be evolutionary. Organis ations should expect to take some time and \nexercise reasonable effort to det ermine what is reasonable in their circumstances. \nAs being reasonable is not a black and white issue, organisations and individuals may \nfind that there will be different expectatio ns about what is reasonable. In assessing \nwhat is reasonable, a possible ste p that an organisation could take is to view the \nsituation from the perspective of the individual and consider what the individual \nwould think as fair.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf1e9356-4fb9-46af-b04a-fc1f26633714": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf1e9356-4fb9-46af-b04a-fc1f26633714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "232686f2-c692-467a-9988-544831fc23bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "5f540dc8894dde80328960d069b27e3b89d55b07ae380d83245f4362d3ff6f5d"}}, "hash": "8661d676f97b7c30af0ef48217a9d1f7137c053ea31232748590976be158de17", "text": "34 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \nPART III: THE DATA PROT ECTION PROVISIONS  \n Overview of the Data Protection Provisions  \n Organisations  are required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions in Parts 3 \nto 6A of the PDPA. When considering what they should do to comply with the Data \nProtection Provisions, organi sations should note that they are responsible for \npersonal data in their pos session or under their control4.

These obligations may be summarised \nas follows. The sections of the PDPA which set out these obligations are noted below \nfor reference.  \na) The Consent Obligation (PDPA sections 13 to 17): An organi sation must \nobtain the consent of the individua l before collecting, using or disclosing his \npersonal data for a purpose.  \nb) The Purpose Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 18): An organisation may \ncollect, use or disclose personal data about an individual onl y for purposes \nthat a reasonable person would c onsider appropriate in the circumstances \nand, if applicable, have been notified to the individual concerned.  \nc) The Notification Obligation (PDPA section 20): An organisation must notify \nthe individual of the pur pose(s) for which it intends to collect, use or  disclose \nthe individual\u2019s personal data on or before such collection, use or disclosure \nof the personal data.  \nd) The Access and Correction Obligations (PDPA sections 21 , 22 and 22A ): An \norganisation must, upon r equest , (i) provide an individual with his or h er \npersonal data in the possession or under the control of the organisation and \ninformation about the ways in which the personal data may have been used \nor disclosed during the past year; and (ii) correct an e rror or omission in an \nindividual\u2019s personal da ta that is in the possession or under the control of \nthe organisation.  \n \n4 See PDPA sec tion 11(2).  \n5 See PDPA section 4(3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82bde8e7-36c3-4619-a64c-e6cea12a5d0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "82bde8e7-36c3-4619-a64c-e6cea12a5d0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8d032ee-465d-4974-837a-6ccbe4ad5146", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "47ebc19ab77012f13b13f9b7284dbc4519c566bbe596e953f2e862f5d2150b53"}}, "hash": "4cd61bb4afa7311dddd5095d2d5c217d3993af1c38b240f43632c0b32452227e", "text": "35 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n  \ne) The Accuracy Obligation (PDPA section 23): An organisation must make a \nreasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected by or o n behalf of \nthe organisation is accurate and co mplete if the personal data is likely to be  \nused by the organisation to make a decision that affects the individual \nconcerned or disclosed  by the organisation to another organisation.  \nf) The Protection Obligation  (PDPA section 24): An organisation must protec t \npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable \nsecurity arrangements to prevent (i) unauthorised access, collection, use, \ndisclosure, copying, modification  or disposal , or similar risks ; and ( ii) the loss \nof any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored . \ng) The Retention Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 25): An organisation \nmust cease to retain documents containing personal data, or remove the \nmeans by which the pers onal data can be associated with particular \nindividuals as soon as it is reasonable to assume that (i) the purpose for \nwhich the personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention \nof the personal data ; and (ii) retention is no longer necess ary for legal or \nbusiness purposes.  \nh) The Transfer Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 26): An organisation must \nnot transfer personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except \nin accordance with the requirements prescribed under the PDPA.   \ni) The Data Breach Notification Obligatio n (PDPA sections 26A to 26E): An \norganisation must assess whether a data breach  is notifiable  and notify the \naffected individuals and/or the Commission  where it is assessed to be \nnotifiable . \nj) The Accountability  Obligation  (PDPA sections 11 and 12): An organ isation \nmust implement the necessary policies and procedures in order to meet its \nobligations under the PDPA and shall make information about its policies \nand procedures publicly available.  \n Some of the ten obligations me ntioned above may have other related requirements \nwhich organisations must comply with.

Such consent provides the clearest indication that the individual has \nconsented to notified purposes of the collection, use or disclosure of  his personal \ndata.  \n In situations where it may be im practical for the organisation to obtain express \nconsent in writing, it may choose to obtain verbal consent.

These are, in brief:  \na) where the  third -party source can validly give consent to the collection, use \nand disclosure of the individual\u2019s personal data (under section 14(4) of the \nPDPA); or  \nb) where the individual has consented, or is d eemed to have consented, to the \ndisclosure of his or her personal data by the third -party source (under \nsection 15 of the PDPA).  \n Examples of the above situations could be a referral from an existing customer, \nwhere an individual has allowed another (the e xisting customer) to give consent to \nthe collection of his personal data by the organisation, or the purchase of a database \ncontai ning personal data from a database reseller who had obtained consent for the \ndisclosure of the personal data.   \n There could al so be cases, especially with organisations that operate in a group \nstructure, where one organisation in the group has validly obta ined consent to the \ncollection, use and disclosure of an individual\u2019s personal data for the purposes of \nother organisations in  the corporate group.

In this regard, considerations  for whether the individual has given \nreasonable notice would inclu de the amount of time needed to give effect to the \nwithdrawal of consent and the manner in which notice was given.   \n The Commission considers that it would be difficult to take a one -size-fits-all \napproach and prescribe a specific time frame for reasonable  notice to be given.  \nHowever, as a general rule of thumb, the Commission would consider a withdrawal \nnotice of at least ten (10) business days from the day the organisation receives the \nwithdrawal notice , to be reasonable notice. Should an organisation re quire more \ntime to give effect to a withdrawal notice, it is good practice for the organisation to \ninform the individual of the time frame by which the withdrawal of consent will take \neffec t.  \n In order to enable and facilitate withdrawal, organisations are  advised to make an \nappropriate consent withdrawal policy that is clear and easily accessible to the \nindividuals concerned. This withdrawal policy should, for example:  \na) advise the individual s on the form and manner to submit a notice to \nwithdraw their conse nt for specific purposes;  \nb) indicate the person to whom, or the means by which, the notice to withdraw \nconsent should be submitted; and  \nc) distinguish between purposes necessary and optional to the provision of the \nproducts/services (that may include the servic e of the existing business \nrelationship).

In some situations, the existence of restrictions may not \nprevent the data from being pu blicly available.   \n For example, if personal data is disclos ed to a closed online group but membership \nin the group is relatively open and members of the public could join with minimal \neffort, then the disclosure may amount to making the data publicly avai lable. \nConversely, if personal data is disclosed to a close circle of the individual\u2019s family and \nfriends or it is inadvertently disclosed to a single member of the public who is not \npersonally known to the individual concerned, the disclosures may not mak e the \npersonal data publicly available.   \nExample:  \nAlan is a member of an online social network that is open to the public25. His \nmembership profile which is publicly searchable lists his name, date of birth \nand the university at which he is currently enrolled. Alan also regularly updates \nhis profile picture. The d ata (including pictures of him) which Alan has shared \non this on line social network is very likely to be personal data that is publicly \navailable, since any other user of the social network would be able to gain \naccess to the data, even if they accessed hi s profile page by accident and any \nmember of public may join the  online social network.  \nBob is a member of the same social network. However, Bob\u2019s membership \nprofile is only accessible by a few users who are personally known to him and \nto whom he has gran ted permission to access his profile. Bob has also placed \nrestri ctions on the re -posting of his profile. The personal data on Bob\u2019s \nmembership profile is less likely to be considered publicly available since \naccess to the data is strictly limited.  \n The Com mission recognises that personal data that is publicly available at one point \nin time may, for various reasons, no longer be publicly available after that time.  For \nexample, users of social networking sites may change their privacy settings from ti me \nto time, which would have an impact on whether their personal data would be \nconsidered publicly available.   \n \n25 The Commission notes  that organisations which operate websites or applications may subject their users to a \nstandard set of terms and c onditions, which could include reserving the right to make the personal data of users \npublicly available (or disclose the personal data in sp ecified ways) that could be contrary to their users\u2019 personal \npreferences to restrict access to their personal data .

Hence, the Commission take s the position that so long as the persona l \ndata in question was publicly available at the point of collection, organisations will \nbe able to use and disclose personal data without consent under the corresponding \nexceptions, notwithstanding that the personal data may no longer be publicly \navailabl e at the point in time when it is used or disclosed.  \n Publicly available personal data also includes a category of personal data that is \nspecifically included in the definition, that is, personal data observed in public.

Generally speaking, photo -taking is reasonably expected in a location like \na store that is open to the public. Therefore, it would be reasonably expected \nfor Jeff\u2019s personal da ta to be captured by Store XYZ\u2019s photographer (or by \nother photo -taking equipment, e.g. smart phones of fellow patrons). However, \nas good p ractice, Store XYZ should put up relevant notices to inform its \ncustomers about the photographer.   \nJeff leaves the s hopping mall and enters a public park where filming for a TV \nshow is taking place.  His image was captured by the film crew in the course of  \nfilming the show.  In this case, it would be reasonably expected that his image \ncould be captured by the film crew.   However, as good practice , the film crew \nshould put up notices at appropriate locations (e.g. at the entrances to the \npark) to inform park users that filming is taking place.  \n A location or event would be considered \u201copen to the public\u201d if members of the \npublic can enter or access the location with few or no restrictions. Generally \nspeaking, the more restrictions there are for access to a par ticular location, the less \nlikely it would be considered \u201copen to the public\u201d. Relevant considerations would be \nfacto rs that affect the ease and ability with which the public can gain access to the \nplace. Examples include the presence or absence of physica l barriers, such as fences, \nwalls and gates, around the place; the conditions and effectiveness of these barriers; \nand the employment of security systems, sentries and patrols aimed at restricting \nentry.   \n However, the mere existence of some restrictions is  not sufficient to prevent the \nlocation from being regarded as open to the public. F or example, events that may be \nentered only upon payment of a fee by a member of the public may be considered \nto be open to the public for the purposes of the PDPA.  Similar ly, special events for \nmembers of a retailer\u2019s loyalty programme may also be considered open to the \npublic, depending  on relevant factors such as whether the event was open to a large \nnumber of members.  \n The Commission recognises that there can be private s paces within public spaces. In \nsome situations, a private event may be held at a location that is usually open to the  \npublic. For example, an individual may book an entire restaurant for a private dinner. \nIn such situations, as members of the public cannot  enter the location during the \nevent, the event is not open to the public. In addition, a location is not open to the  \npublic merely because members of the public may look into the premises or location. \nFor example, if members of the public are not able to enter residential premises or \ncommercial premises that are closed for a private event, the ability to observe what \nis happening inside the premises would not make the premises open to the public. \nAnother example would be the interior of a taxi for the dura tion when it is hired by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65485169-c777-4df6-8555-b37563a12e6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "65485169-c777-4df6-8555-b37563a12e6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14903664-bc21-4e70-9ab6-71128d49229d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "600f44ffef3ce25e72d3aab76f580469975e2261ddff661b5990fca24ca310f0"}}, "hash": "91ba9cdfb2db91ea4aeacf5563e936b15d88c31c6e4e8f62d237c2af06a22f56", "text": "79 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \na passenger.

That is, organisations are not required to inform individuals of the purposes \nfor which their personal data will be collected, used or disclosed if:  \na) the individ ual is deemed to have consented to the collection, use or \ndisclosure of his or her personal data under section 15  or 15A  of the PDPA; \nor \nb) the organisation is collecting, using or disclosing the personal data without \nthe consent of the individual concerned i n accordance with section 17 of the \nPDPA (that is, in the circumstances specified in the First and Second \nSchedules to t he PDPA).  \n It is important for an organisation to identify the purposes for which it is collecting, \nusing or disclosing personal data by establishing the appropriate policies and \nprocedures. These would enable the organisation to identify what personal data  it \nneeds to collect, use and disclose for its business purposes and to ensure that the \npersonal data collected is consistent with the p urposes identified. It would also \nminimise the risk of collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of  \nthe Data Protection Provisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87c433e0-83a2-499d-ac1b-83bbe9c44fe8": {"__data__": {"id_": "87c433e0-83a2-499d-ac1b-83bbe9c44fe8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9ab12d4-7aa6-44a2-abc6-7107bce6f018", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-08"}, "hash": "51a705afcdbab93ad7cb528dac42387e13ff579c36d77786dd4c27bffaea451b"}}, "hash": "7a09bc3560bfe1edcff6ff8a6a2f6429c63350053d696f859a8f513b48224125", "text": "83 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n The following paragraphs consider three important issues relating to the Notification \nObligation:  \na) when  an organisation must inform the individual of its purposes;  \nb) the manner and form in which the organisation should inform  the individual \nof its purposes; and  \nc) the information and details to be included when an organisation states its \npurposes.  \nWhen an organi sation must inform the individual of its purposes  \n Under section 20 (1) , (4) and (5)  of the PDPA, an organisation must in form the \nindividual of the purposes for which his personal data will be collected, used or \ndisclosed on or before such collection, use o r disclosure (as the case may be).

In \naddition, organisations are required to make information available on such  policies \nand procedures. Organisations may wish to develop a Data Protection Policy (also \nreferred to as a Privacy Policy) to set out i ts policies and procedures for complying \nwith the PDPA27.

For example, if an organisation has transferred personal data to a data \nintermediary that is processing the personal data under the control of the \norganisation, the organisation\u2019s response to an access or correction request must \ntake into account th e personal data which is in the possession of the data \nintermediary.

In this rega rd, an \norganisation may develop a standard list of all possible third parties to whom \npersonal data may have been disclosed by the organisation. In many cases, an \norganisation may provide this standard list as an alt ernative to providing the specific \nset o f third parties to whom the personal data has been disclosed, as part of its \nresponse to access requests that ask for information relating to how the personal \ndata has been or may have been disclosed within the past year. The organisation \nshould also updat e the standard list regularly and ensure that the information is \naccurate before providing the list to the individual. Generally, in responding to a \nrequest for information on third parties to which personal data has  been disclosed, \nthe organisation should  individually identify each possible third party (e.g. \n\u2018pharmaceutical company ABC\u2019), instead of simply providing general categories of \norganisations (e.g. \u2018pharmaceutical companies\u2019) to which personal data has been \ndisclosed. This would allow individuals to directly approach the third party \norganisation to which their  personal data has been disclosed.  \n15.16  In specifying how the personal data has been or may have been used or disclosed \nwithin the past year, organisations may provide information on the purposes rather \nthan the specific activities for which the personal data had been or may have been \nused or disclosed. For example, an organisation may have disclosed personal data to \nexternal auditors on multiple occasions in  the year before the access request.

In addition, noting that \nthe supporting documents previously obtained for the credit card application \nare now dated two years back, the bank asked Nick to provide a copy of his \nmost recent payslip and proof of employment. In t his scena rio, the bank has \nmade a reasonable effort to ensure that the personal data collected from Nick \nis accurate and complete.   \nEnsuring accuracy when collecting personal data from a third party source  \n16.7 An organisation should also be more careful when collecti ng personal data about an \nindividual from a source other than the individual in question. It is allowed to take \ndiffering approaches to ascertain the accuracy and completeness of personal data it \ncollects depending on the reliability of the source of the d ata. For example, the \norganisation may obtain confirmation from the source of the personal data that the \nsource had verified the accuracy and completeness of that personal data. It may also \nconduct f urther independent verification if it deems prudent to do  so. \nExample:  \nNick will be attending an adventure camp for his company\u2019s team -building \npurposes.

Not all types of personal data require updates. Obvious examples include \nfactual data, for example, historical data. However, where the use of outdated \npersonal data  in a decision -making process could affect the individual , then it would \nbe prudent for the organisation to update such personal data.  \nExample:  \nA company is considering whether an existing employee, John, should be \ntransferred to take on a different role in its IT department.

Such circumstances include  \ntransferring personal data  to another company within the same group for centralised \ncorporate functions , or to a data intermediary for data processing.  In situations \nwhere personal data transferred or situated overseas remains in the possession or \ncontrol of an organisation, the  organisation has to comply with all the Data  \nProtection Provis ions. Such situations include where an  employee travels overseas \nwith customer lists on his notebook ; an organisation owns  or leases  and operates a \nwarehouse overseas for archival of customer records ; or an organisation stores \npersonal da ta in an overseas data centre on servers that it owns and directly  \nmaintains . In these examples, the organisation has direct primary obligations  under \nthe Data Protection Provisions to, inter alia , protect the personal data, give effect to \naccess and correction requests, an d include these overseas data repositories in its \ndata retention  polic y. \n19.2 This is because t he Transfer Limitation Obligation is a manifestation of the \nAccountability Obligation . Wh en an organisation discloses personal data to another \norganisation, and both are in Singapore, the receiving organisation is subject to the \nPDPA and has to protect the personal data that it thereby receives . Likewise, when \nan organisation discloses persona l data to its data intermediary, and both are in \nSingapore, the data intermed iary is subject to the Protection, Retention Limitation \nand Data Breach Notification Obligations  for the personal data that it thereby \nreceives . However,  when an organisation transfers  personal data to another \norganisation that is outside Singapore (for ex ample,  a data intermediary  or another \ncompany in the same group ), the recipient  organisation is not subject to the PDPA. \nThe Accountability Obligation  requires that the transferring  organisation takes steps \nto ensure that the recipient  organisation will co ntinue to protect the personal data \nthat it has received to a standard that is comparable to that established in PDPA.  This \nis the raison d\u2019etre  for the Transfer Limitat ion Obligation.   \n19.3 Thus , section 26(1) provides that an organisation must not transfer a ny personal data \nto a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements \nprescribed under the PDPA , i.e.  to ensure that organisations provide a standard of \nprotection to transferred personal data that is comparable to the protect ion under \nthe PDPA.

Data int ermediaries that process \nthe personal data o n behalf and for the purposes of another organisation (including \na public agency) are also required to notify that other organisation or public agency \nof a data breach detected.

This may include situa tions where the organisation can determine the \npurposes for which the personal data is collected, used or disclosed, or the manner \nand means by which the data is processed. This general concept of accountability is \nin Part 3 of the PDPA on \u201cGeneral Rules w ith Respect to Protection of and \nAccountability for Pers onal Data\u201d and premised on  section 11(2) within Part 3 of the \nPDPA, which states, \u201cAn organisation is responsible for personal data in its \npossession or under its control.\u201d . \n21.2 Accountability  under  the P DPA requires organisations to undertake measures in \norder to ensure that they meet their obligations under the PDPA and, importantly, \ndemonstrate that they can do so when required. Some of these measures are \nspeci fically required under the PDPA. F or exampl e, designating  one or more \nindividuals to be respons ible for ensuring the organisation\u2019s compliance with the \nPDPA , developing  and implementing policies and practices that are necessary for the \norganisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA (\u201cdata prot ection policies and \npractices\u201d),  and making informat ion about their data protection policies and \npractices available. Other measures as described at para graph  21.15  are not \nmandatory but are good practices to help org anisations in meeting their obligations \nunder the PDPA.  \nAppointing a Data Protection Officer  \n21.3 Section 11(3) of the PDPA requires an organisation to designate  one or more \nindividuals to be responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with the \nPDPA. This ind ividual is typically referred to as a DPO. Section 11(4) further provides \nthat an individual so designated by an organisation may delegate the responsibility \nconferred by that designation to another individual.  Section 11(6) clarifies that the \ndesignation  of an individual by an organisation under section 11(3) does not relieve \nthe organisation of any of its obligations under the PDPA. That is, legal responsibility  \nfor complying with the PDPA remains with the organisation and is not transferred t o \nthe desig nated individual(s). On the whole, these provisions require organisations to \ndesignate the appropriate individuals, who may in turn delegate certain \nresponsibilities to other officers, so that collectively, they co -operate to ensure that \n \n80 Previously known as the \u201cOpenness Obligation\u201d.

The responsibilities of the DPO often include working \nwith senior management and the organisation\u2019s business unit s to develo p and \nimplement appropriate data protection policies and practices for the organisation . \nIn addition, the DPO would undertake  a wide range of activities, which may include \nproducing (or guiding the production of) a personal data inventory, condu cting data \nprotection impact assessments, monitoring and reporting data protection risks, \nproviding internal training on data protection compliance, engaging with \nstakeholders on data protection matters and generally acting as the primary internal \nexpert o n data prot ection. Depending on the organisation\u2019s needs, the DPO may also \nwork with (or have additional responsibilities relating to) the organisation\u2019s data \ngovernance and cybersecurity functions . The DPO can also play a role in supporting \nan organisatio n\u2019s innovat ion. \n21.5 Individual(s) designated by an organisation under section 11(3) should be: (a) \nsufficiently skilled and knowledgeable; and (b) amply empowered, to discharge their \nduties as a DPO, although they need not be an employee of the organisation. \nOrganisation s should ensure that individuals appointed as a DPO are trained and \ncertified82. The individual(s) should ideally be a member of the organisation\u2019s senior \nmanagement team or have a direct reporting line to the senior management to \nensure the eff ective devel opment and implementation of the organisation\u2019s data \nprotection policies and practices. As part of corporate governance, the commitment \nand involvement of senior management is key to ensure that there is accountability \nand oversight over the ma nagement of personal data in the organisation.  \n21.6 The DPO (or someone working with him) may also be the primary contact point for \nthe organisation\u2019s data protection matters.

Policies can be internal or \nexternal facing; and practices can include  establishing  governance structures  and \ndesigning process es to operationalise policies .

This also entails \nensur ing th at policies and practices are easily accessible to the intended reader . \nFurthermore, t he organisation should put in place monitoring mechanisms and \nprocess controls to ensure the effective implementation of these policies and \npractices.  \n21.10  Secondly, an  organis ation must develop a process to receive and respond to \ncomplaints that may arise with respect to the application of the PDPA87. This is to \nensure that the organisation can effectively address individuals\u2019 complaints and \nconcerns with its data protec tion po licies and practices and aid in its overall \ncompliance efforts.  \n21.11  Thirdly, an organisation is required to provide staff training and  communicate to its \nstaff information about its policies and practices88.

They diverge from a single experience to multiple possibilities. When they learn they will ask 'why', and will start from detail to logically work up to the big picture. They like working with others but like things to remain calm \u2013 they will be distressed by conflicts in the group. They like to receive constructive feedback.   CONVERGERS (Abstract conceptualization/Active experimenter) think about things and then try out their ideas to see if they work in practice. When they learn they will ask 'how', and will want to learn by understanding how things work in practice. They like facts and will seek to make things efficient by making small and careful changes. They prefer to work alone or independently.  ACCOMODATORS (Concrete experiencer/Active experimenter) have the most hands-on approach, with a strong preference for doing rather than thinking. When they lean they will ask 'what if?' and 'why not?' to support their action-first approach. They do not like routine and will take creative risks to see what happens. They learn better by themselves than with others.  ASSIMILATORS (Abstract conceptualiser/Reflective observer) have the most cognitive approach, preferring to think than to act. When they learn they will ask 'What is there I can know?' and like organised and structured understanding.  Lectures are their preference, with demonstrations where possible, and will respect the knowledge of experts. People with this style will have a strong control need. They learn best with lectures that start from high-level concepts and work down to the detail.
