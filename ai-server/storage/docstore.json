The PDPA contains two (2) main sets of provisions, covering data \nprotection and the Do Not Call registry, which organisations are required to comply \nwith.   \n The PDP A\u2019s data protection obligations are set out in Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA (the \n\u201cData Protection Provisions\u201d). In brief, the Data Protection Provisions deal with the \nfollowing matters:  \na) Having reasonable purposes, notify ing purposes and obtaining consent for  \nthe collection, use or disclosure of personal data;  \nb) Allowing individuals to access and correct their personal data;  \nc) Taking care of personal data (which relates to ensuring accuracy), protecting \npersonal data (includin g protection in the case of internatio nal transfers) \nand not retaining personal data if no longer needed;  \nd) Notifying the Commission  and affected individuals of data breaches; and \ne) Having policies and practices to comply with the PDPA.  \n The PDPA provides a nu mber of exceptions to various Data Pro tection Provisions to \naddress situations where organisations may have a legitimate need, for example, to \ncollect, use or disclose personal data without consent or to refuse to provide an \nindividual with access to his p ersonal data.  \n The PDPA\u2019s Do Not Call R egistry provisions are set out in Part s 9 and 9A of the PDPA \n(the \u201cDo Not Call Provisions\u201d). These deal with the establishment of Singapore\u2019s \nnational Do Not Call Registry (the \u201cDo Not Call Registry\u201d) and the obligatio ns of \norganisations relating to the se nding of certain marketing messages to Singapore \ntelephone numbers. The Do Not Call Registry comprise s three (3) separate registers \nkept and maintained by the Commission under section 39 of the PDPA (the \u201cDo Not \nCall R egisters\u201d) which cover telephone calls , text messages and faxes. Users and \nsubscribers may register their Singapore telephone number(s) on one or more Do \nNot Call Registers depending on their preferences in relation to receiving marketing \nmessages through telephone calls, text messages or faxe s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1361e7e7-8907-421c-8277-444856fecf1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1361e7e7-8907-421c-8277-444856fecf1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b54d7c-d924-4f27-a6a4-9c82548a224d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "3c566f5dc70b8267b201c0a14a137b64d2c97a21a6b6600155fdc37427763d4f"}}, "hash": "6257e68dbdb39d221bdfd6d91f954ccea8447e3bb8da4d012048077d511c5f91", "text": "9 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n Organisations have the following obligations in relation to sending certain marketing \nmessages to Singapore telephone numbers:  \na) Checking the relevant Do Not Call Register(s) to confirm if the Singapore \ntelephone number is listed on the Do Not Call Re gister(s);  \nb) Providing information on the individual or organisation who sent or \nauthorised the sending of the marketing message; and  \nc) Not concealing or withholding the calling line identity of the sender of the \nmarketing  message.  \n The PDPA recognises that org anisations may not need to check the Do Not Call \nRegisters in certain circumstances, in particular, when the user or subscriber of a \nSingapore telephone number has given clear and unambiguous consent in written or \nothe r accessible form to the sending of th e marketing message to that number. In \naddition, certain organisations that are in an ongoing relationship with individuals \nwould  not need  to check the Do Not Call Registry before sending certain messages \nrelated to th e subject of the ongoing relationship.  \n Further, organisations are prohibited from sending any messages to any telephone \nnumber that is generated or obtained through the use of address -harvesting \nsoftware , or to use dictionary attacks or similar automated m eans to send messages \nindiscriminately . Please refer to the Advisory Guidelines on the Do Not Call Provisions \nfor more information.  \n The Data Protection Provisions and the Do Not Call Provisions are intended to \noperate in conjunction. Accordingly, organisa tions are required to comply with both \nsets of provisions when collecting and using Singapore telephone numbers that form \npart of ind ividuals\u2019 personal data. Organisations need not comply with the Data \nProtection Provisions for Singapore telephone numbers that do not form part of an \nindividual\u2019s personal data but  would still be required to comply with the Do Not Call \nProvisions.   \n Part 9B of the PDPA sets out o ffences that hold  individuals accountable for egregious \nmishandling of personal data . The offences are for knowing or reckless unauthorised \n(a) disclosure of personal data; (b) use of personal data for a wrongful gain or a \nwrongful loss to any person; and (c) re -identification of anonymised data . \n Other parts of the PDPA (which are not specifically addre ssed in these Guidelines) \ndeal with the administration of the PDPA and certain preliminary and general \nmatters.

This may be distinguished from \njuridical persons or \u201clegal persons\u201d which are other entities that have their own legal \npersonality and are capable of taking legal action in their own name. An example of \nsuch a \u201clegal person\u201d is a body corpo rate such as a company. The term \u201cnatural \nperson\u201d would also exclude unincorporated groups of individuals such as an \nassociation which may take legal action in its own name1. \n Accordingly, since the various Data Protectio n Provisions are concerned with the \npersonal data of individuals, only the personal data of natural persons is protected \nunder the PDPA.

These are highlighted in the \nsections later.  Please also refer to the chapter on \u201cAnonymisation\u201d in the Advisory \nGuidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, which describes the consider ations and \nconditions under which personal data may be anonymised and no longer considered \npersonal data for the purposes of the PDPA.  \nWhen is data considered \u201cpersonal data\u201d?  \n The most basic requirement for data to cons titute personal data is that it is \ninformation  about an identifiable  individual.  There are two principal considerations. \nFirst, is the purpose  of information to be data about an individual or which relates to \nthe individual. Examples  include information about an individual\u2019s health, \neducatio nal and employment background, as well as an individual\u2019s activities such as \nspending patterns. There will be situations where the personal data is incidental to \nthe purpose of the information . For  example , an internal investigations report that \nincidental ly includes names and appointme nts of  key actors involved in the incident \nunder investigations. The content of individuals\u2019 c ommunications, such as email \nmessages and text messages, in and of thems elves will generally not be considered \npersonal data, unles s they contain information about an individual that can identify \nthe individual.   \n Second, the individual should be identifiable  from the data. However, n ot all data \nthat relates to an individual may identify the individual.  For example,  a residential \naddre ss could also relate to another individual who resides there,  and it may not be \npossible to identify  a specific individual  from the residential address. Data constitutes \npersonal data if it is data about an individual who can be identified from that data o n \nits own, or from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26503b79-85af-42e4-904a-942268bd4936": {"__data__": {"id_": "26503b79-85af-42e4-904a-942268bd4936", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "919b8ea8-776b-4cf1-a524-260e2fa36ca8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "512bf81be897e343f575fb39bc333141ef32e51c39f470a0e3dd19598c1d3a7b"}}, "hash": "ce068602d50571996dd7411a44c88247860726d8f303acb26c54b8d6895fa45c", "text": "13 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \nlikely to have access.  For example, a mailing list of email addresses may not be \npersonal data on  its own, but if the list contains customer IDs that can be linked to \nrecords in the Customer Relationship Management (\u201c CRM \u201d) system, then the list \nmay be considered personal data.  \n A practical approach is to first identify the set of information  under consideration  \n(e.g. information recorded in documents and stored in files, o r stored in electronic \ndatabases or IT systems ). Next, organisations should a pply the analysis in the \npreceding paragraphs and ask : (a) is the purpose of this set of informa tion about \nindividuals ; and (b) can individuals be identified from this set of info rmation or other \ninformation they  have access to.  In general, organisations should avoid making \nassess ments in the abstract . The following paragraphs set out a few of the \nCommission\u2019s considerations in determining personal data.  \nNumber of data elements in  the dataset and availability of other information  \n The rule of thumb is that there should be at least two data elements in the dataset \nbefore individuals can be identified . Sometimes, more than two data elements may \nbe required before an individual can be identified. This depends very much on the \nspecifici ty and nature of the data elements. For example, the combination of name \nand NRIC number is usually sufficient to identify individuals, but email addresses may \nneed to be combined with customer shopping pr eferences and purchase history \nbefore individuals c an be identified from this combination of data elements.  In \ndetermining whether the dataset is personal data , an organisation should not \noverlook the availability of other information it has or is likely t o have access to.  For \nexample, a unique customer ID  that can link a mailing list to the CRM system.   \n In general, the Commission will apply a \u201cpracticability\u201d threshold in determining \nwhether an organisation is likely to have access to other data that will identify an \nindividual. As such, an organisation wi ll not be considered to have access to other \ninformation if it is not practicable (e.g. where it requires huge costs, time, resources) \neven though it is theoretically or technically possible for the organi sation to gain \naccess to such information.  \nNature  of data  \n Certain types of data , by their nature or use,  are more likely to  identify an individual . \nThis includes data that has been assigned exclusively to an individual for the \npurposes of identifying the individual (e.g. NRIC or passport number of an ind ividual) , \nor data of a bio logical  nature (e.g. DNA, facial image, fingerprint, iris prints) . In \ngeneral, fewer  data elements are required for a dataset to constitute personal data  \nif it contains data points  or data elements  that are more unique to an indiv idual .

In such sit uations, the information would not constitute business \ncontact information and organi sations would be required to comply with the Data \nProtection Provisions in respect of such information.

She provides her business name \ncard to the gym staff so that they can record her name and contact details in \norder to reg ister her for the package. In this case, the information provided by \nSharon would not be business contact information as she is providing it solely \nfor her personal purposes.

For example, section 11(1) states that an organisation must , in \nmeeting its responsibilities under the PDPA , consider what a reasonable person \nwould consider appropriate in the circum stances. Other Data Protection Provisions \nsimilarly make reference to something or some set of circumstances which is \nreasonable.  \n Section 11(1) does not impose a separate obligatio n on organisations but requires \nthem to consider \u201cwhat a reasonable person w ould consider appropriate in the \ncircumstances\u201d when they undertake any action that is subject to the Data \nProtection Provisions. In seeking to comply with the Data Protection Prov isions, \norganisations should therefore act based on what a reasonable person  would \nconsider appropriate in the circumstances.   \n The PDPA recognises that a balance needs to be struck between the need to protect \nindividuals\u2019 personal data and the need of org anisations to collect, use or disclose \npersonal data. The PDPA seeks to prov ide such a balance by allowing organisations \nto collect, use and disclose personal data for purposes which a reasonable person \nwould consider appropriate in the circumstances and s imilarly requires organisations \nto act based on this standard of reasonablen ess. \n In determining what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the \ncircumstances, an organisation should consider the particular circumstance it is \nfacing. Taking those  circumstances into consideration, the organisation should \ndetermine what wo uld be the appropriate course of action to take in order to comply \nwith its obligations under the PDPA based on what a reasonable person would \nconsider appropriate.  \n A \u201creasonable p erson\u201d is judged based on an objective standard and can be said to \nbe a pers on who exercises the appropriate care and  judgement  in the particular \ncircumstance.  The Commission notes that the standard of reasonableness is \nexpected to be evolutionary. Organis ations should expect to take some time and \nexercise reasonable effort to det ermine what is reasonable in their circumstances. \nAs being reasonable is not a black and white issue, organisations and individuals may \nfind that there will be different expectatio ns about what is reasonable.

These obligations may be summarised \nas follows. The sections of the PDPA which set out these obligations are noted below \nfor reference.  \na) The Consent Obligation (PDPA sections 13 to 17): An organi sation must \nobtain the consent of the individua l before collecting, using or disclosing his \npersonal data for a purpose.  \nb) The Purpose Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 18): An organisation may \ncollect, use or disclose personal data about an individual onl y for purposes \nthat a reasonable person would c onsider appropriate in the circumstances \nand, if applicable, have been notified to the individual concerned.  \nc) The Notification Obligation (PDPA section 20): An organisation must notify \nthe individual of the pur pose(s) for which it intends to collect, use or  disclose \nthe individual\u2019s personal data on or before such collection, use or disclosure \nof the personal data.  \nd) The Access and Correction Obligations (PDPA sections 21 , 22 and 22A ): An \norganisation must, upon r equest , (i) provide an individual with his or h er \npersonal data in the possession or under the control of the organisation and \ninformation about the ways in which the personal data may have been used \nor disclosed during the past year; and (ii) correct an e rror or omission in an \nindividual\u2019s personal da ta that is in the possession or under the control of \nthe organisation.  \n \n4 See PDPA sec tion 11(2).  \n5 See PDPA section 4(3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b2c8c44-fc8f-4389-a3b8-2f45da44009b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b2c8c44-fc8f-4389-a3b8-2f45da44009b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "171afa01-9100-4701-987d-fe4b4fcd1428", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "3b822d38cf761fdf78841d61be1ee26ba8a4e876c0b50f37de0f4adc419e0948"}}, "hash": "1b2e69027a69ddb64c356cb4802aa086f65d10e64bd21bf9ad6442e04b7b8333", "text": "35 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \n  \ne) The Accuracy Obligation (PDPA section 23): An organisation must make a \nreasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected by or o n behalf of \nthe organisation is accurate and co mplete if the personal data is likely to be  \nused by the organisation to make a decision that affects the individual \nconcerned or disclosed  by the organisation to another organisation.  \nf) The Protection Obligation  (PDPA section 24): An organisation must protec t \npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable \nsecurity arrangements to prevent (i) unauthorised access, collection, use, \ndisclosure, copying, modification  or disposal , or similar risks ; and ( ii) the loss \nof any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored . \ng) The Retention Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 25): An organisation \nmust cease to retain documents containing personal data, or remove the \nmeans by which the pers onal data can be associated with particular \nindividuals as soon as it is reasonable to assume that (i) the purpose for \nwhich the personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention \nof the personal data ; and (ii) retention is no longer necess ary for legal or \nbusiness purposes.  \nh) The Transfer Limitation Obligation (PDPA section 26): An organisation must \nnot transfer personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except \nin accordance with the requirements prescribed under the PDPA.   \ni) The Data Breach Notification Obligatio n (PDPA sections 26A to 26E): An \norganisation must assess whether a data breach  is notifiable  and notify the \naffected individuals and/or the Commission  where it is assessed to be \nnotifiable . \nj) The Accountability  Obligation  (PDPA sections 11 and 12): An organ isation \nmust implement the necessary policies and procedures in order to meet its \nobligations under the PDPA and shall make information about its policies \nand procedures publicly available.  \n Some of the ten obligations me ntioned above may have other related requirements \nwhich organisations must comply with.

For all other purposes, section 13 \nof the PDPA provides that organisations are allowed to collect, us e or disclos e an \nindividual\u2019s personal data if the individual gives  his consent for the collection, use or \ndisclosure of his personal data. This obligation to obtain the individual\u2019s conse nt is \nreferred to in these Guidelines as the Consent Obligation.  \n This obligation does not apply where the collection, use or disclosure of an \nindividual\u2019s p ersonal data is required or authorised under the PDPA or any other \nwritten law. However, organisatio ns may still need to comply with other \nrequirements of the D ata Protection  Provisions . Please refer to Annex A  for further \ninformation on the framework for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data, \nto obtain consent in a way that is meaningful to  individuals.    \nObtaining consent from an individual  \n Section 14(1) of the PDPA states how an individual gives consent under the PDPA. An \nindividual has not given consent unless the individual has been notified of the \npurposes for which his personal data wi ll be collected, used or disclosed and the \nindividual  has provided his consent for those purposes. If an organisation fails to do \nso, any consent obtained from the individual would be invalid.   \n Consent can be obtained in several ways. Consent that is obta ined in writing or \nrecorded in a manner that is acces sible is referred to in these Guidelines as \u2018express \nconsent\u2019. Such consent provides the clearest indication that the individual has \nconsented to notified purposes of the collection, use or disclosure of  his personal \ndata.  \n In situations where it may be im practical for the organisation to obtain express \nconsent in writing, it may choose to obtain verbal consent.

By proceeding with the tests, Eva is deemed to consent to \nthe collection of her personal data by the clinic for the purposes of the health \ncheck -up. \nExample: Deemed consent for taxi booking  \nTina calls a taxi operator\u2019s hotline to book a taxi. The customer s ervice officer \nasks for her name and number to inform her of the taxi number, which Tina \nprovides voluntarily. Tina is deemed to have consented to the taxi company \nusing her name and number to call or text her when her taxi arrives.  \nHowever, if the taxi op erator runs a limousine service and wants to use Tina\u2019s \ninformation to market this service to her, Tina would not be deemed to have \nconsented to th e use of her personal data for this purpose. This is because Tina \nis providing her personal data for booking a taxi for a single trip, and not for \nreceiving marketing information about the limousine service.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "195b4aa6-fb37-4f49-9d40-03e8df3ea1f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "195b4aa6-fb37-4f49-9d40-03e8df3ea1f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10b21b76-d619-4c1c-a687-173938c64034", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "f63126ebcd1eac021cb53d9dd7abc083edbe7a6e0b32d241f86e009dd4f1b655"}}, "hash": "00bb96738f623ba090d1dd38d8b6f513163380344ed0c1d71f04336d5d90063e", "text": "44 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \nDeemed consent by contractual necessity  \n The sec ond situation in which consent may be deemed is where an individual \nprovides his personal data to one organis ation (\u201cA\u201d) for the purpose of a transaction \nand it is reasonably necessary for A to disclose the personal data to another \norganisation (\u201cB\u201d) for t he necessary conclusion or performance of the transaction \nbetween the individual and A.

In this regard, considerations  for whether the individual has given \nreasonable notice would inclu de the amount of time needed to give effect to the \nwithdrawal of consent and the manner in which notice was given.   \n The Commission considers that it would be difficult to take a one -size-fits-all \napproach and prescribe a specific time frame for reasonable  notice to be given.  \nHowever, as a general rule of thumb, the Commission would consider a withdrawal \nnotice of at least ten (10) business days from the day the organisation receives the \nwithdrawal notice , to be reasonable notice. Should an organisation re quire more \ntime to give effect to a withdrawal notice, it is good practice for the organisation to \ninform the individual of the time frame by which the withdrawal of consent will take \neffec t.  \n In order to enable and facilitate withdrawal, organisations are  advised to make an \nappropriate consent withdrawal policy that is clear and easily accessible to the \nindividuals concerned.

Examples of reasonable \nmeasures and safeguards include minimising the  amount of personal data collected, \nencrypting or immediate deletion o f personal data after use, functional separation, \naccess controls, and other technical or organisational measures that lower the risks \nof personal data being used in ways that may advers ely impact the individual.   \n Where it is assessed that there are likely residual adverse  effects to the individual \nafter implementing the measures, organisations will not be able to rely on deemed \nconsent by notification to collect, use or disclose personal  data for the purpose. \nWhere as for the legitimate interests exception, organisations are required to \nconduct a balancing test as an additional step in the assessment to determine \nwhether the legitimate interests of the organisation or other person (includi ng other \norganisations) outw eigh any likely residual adverse effect on the individual. \nOrganisations may rely on the legitimate interests exception if the legitimate \ninterests outweigh any likely residual adverse effect  to the individual.  \n Joint assessments  may also be conducted by th e disclosing and receiving \norganisations when relying on deemed consent by notification or legitimate interests \nexception to collect and disclose the personal data.

Personal data is generally \navail able to the public if any member of the public could obtain or access the data \nwith few or no restrictions. In some situations, the existence of restrictions may not \nprevent the data from being pu blicly available.   \n For example, if personal data is disclos ed to a closed online group but membership \nin the group is relatively open and members of the public could join with minimal \neffort, then the disclosure may amount to making the data publicly avai lable. \nConversely, if personal data is disclosed to a close circle of the individual\u2019s family and \nfriends or it is inadvertently disclosed to a single member of the public who is not \npersonally known to the individual concerned, the disclosures may not mak e the \npersonal data publicly available.   \nExample:  \nAlan is a member of an online social network that is open to the public25. His \nmembership profile which is publicly searchable lists his name, date of birth \nand the university at which he is currently enrolled. Alan also regularly updates \nhis profile picture. The d ata (including pictures of him) which Alan has shared \non this on line social network is very likely to be personal data that is publicly \navailable, since any other user of the social network would be able to gain \naccess to the data, even if they accessed hi s profile page by accident and any \nmember of public may join the  online social network.  \nBob is a member of the same social network. However, Bob\u2019s membership \nprofile is only accessible by a few users who are personally known to him and \nto whom he has gran ted permission to access his profile. Bob has also placed \nrestri ctions on the re -posting of his profile. The personal data on Bob\u2019s \nmembership profile is less likely to be considered publicly available since \naccess to the data is strictly limited.  \n The Com mission recognises that personal data that is publicly available at one point \nin time may, for various reasons, no longer be publicly available after that time.  For \nexample, users of social networking sites may change their privacy settings from ti me \nto time, which would have an impact on whether their personal data would be \nconsidered publicly available.   \n \n25 The Commission notes  that organisations which operate websites or applications may subject their users to a \nstandard set of terms and c onditions, which could include reserving the right to make the personal data of users \npublicly available (or disclose the personal data in sp ecified ways) that could be contrary to their users\u2019 personal \npreferences to restrict access to their personal data .

Hence, the Commission take s the position that so long as the persona l \ndata in question was publicly available at the point of collection, organisations will \nbe able to use and disclose personal data without consent under the corresponding \nexceptions, notwithstanding that the personal data may no longer be publicly \navailabl e at the point in time when it is used or disclosed.  \n Publicly available personal data also includes a category of personal data that is \nspecifically included in the definition, that is, personal data observed in public.

However, as good practice , the film crew \nshould put up notices at appropriate locations (e.g. at the entrances to the \npark) to inform park users that filming is taking place.  \n A location or event would be considered \u201copen to the public\u201d if members of the \npublic can enter or access the location with few or no restrictions.

Relevant considerations would be \nfacto rs that affect the ease and ability with which the public can gain access to the \nplace. Examples include the presence or absence of physica l barriers, such as fences, \nwalls and gates, around the place; the conditions and effectiveness of these barriers; \nand the employment of security systems, sentries and patrols aimed at restricting \nentry.   \n However, the mere existence of some restrictions is  not sufficient to prevent the \nlocation from being regarded as open to the public.

Similar ly, special events for \nmembers of a retailer\u2019s loyalty programme may also be considered open to the \npublic, depending  on relevant factors such as whether the event was open to a large \nnumber of members.  \n The Commission recognises that there can be private s paces within public spaces. In \nsome situations, a private event may be held at a location that is usually open to the  \npublic. For example, an individual may book an entire restaurant for a private dinner. \nIn such situations, as members of the public cannot  enter the location during the \nevent, the event is not open to the public. In addition, a location is not open to the  \npublic merely because members of the public may look into the premises or location. \nFor example, if members of the public are not able to enter residential premises or \ncommercial premises that are closed for a private event, the ability to observe what \nis happening inside the premises would not make the premises open to the public. \nAnother example would be the interior of a taxi for the dura tion when it is hired by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6896997b-1ab0-4aa1-9bb7-8793ecfba849": {"__data__": {"id_": "6896997b-1ab0-4aa1-9bb7-8793ecfba849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "774b0e87-e277-4954-969a-8d92c2978725", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 1 Oct 2021.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "73c3772314abd14f40aa55d4811fc3c71bc1bd6e77497b0750a8a9610c40cf80"}}, "hash": "a99f217506ef5fe3291c4497b4303162909228a8e91fb6a1d4c5cb9308ac54a1", "text": "79 \n ADVISORY GUIDELINES ON KEY CONCEPTS IN THE PDPA ( Revised 1 October 2021) \na passenger.

For example, if an organisation has transferred personal data to a data \nintermediary that is processing the personal data under the control of the \norganisation, the organisation\u2019s response to an access or correction request must \ntake into account th e personal data which is in the possession of the data \nintermediary.

When assessing an access \nrequest, the organisation should consider the purp ose of the applicant\u2019s acc ess \nrequest, so as to determine the appropriate manner and form in which access to the \npersonal data should be provided.

In this rega rd, an \norganisation may develop a standard list of all possible third parties to whom \npersonal data may have been disclosed by the organisation. In many cases, an \norganisation may provide this standard list as an alt ernative to providing the specific \nset o f third parties to whom the personal data has been disclosed, as part of its \nresponse to access requests that ask for information relating to how the personal \ndata has been or may have been disclosed within the past year. The organisation \nshould also updat e the standard list regularly and ensure that the information is \naccurate before providing the list to the individual. Generally, in responding to a \nrequest for information on third parties to which personal data has  been disclosed, \nthe organisation should  individually identify each possible third party (e.g. \n\u2018pharmaceutical company ABC\u2019), instead of simply providing general categories of \norganisations (e.g. \u2018pharmaceutical companies\u2019) to which personal data has been \ndisclosed. This would allow individuals to directly approach the third party \norganisation to which their  personal data has been disclosed.  \n15.16  In specifying how the personal data has been or may have been used or disclosed \nwithin the past year, organisations may provide information on the purposes rather \nthan the specific activities for which the personal data had been or may have been \nused or disclosed. For example, an organisation may have disclosed personal data to \nexternal auditors on multiple occasions in  the year before the access request.

In addition, noting that \nthe supporting documents previously obtained for the credit card application \nare now dated two years back, the bank asked Nick to provide a copy of his \nmost recent payslip and proof of employment. In t his scena rio, the bank has \nmade a reasonable effort to ensure that the personal data collected from Nick \nis accurate and complete.   \nEnsuring accuracy when collecting personal data from a third party source  \n16.7 An organisation should also be more careful when collecti ng personal data about an \nindividual from a source other than the individual in question. It is allowed to take \ndiffering approaches to ascertain the accuracy and completeness of personal data it \ncollects depending on the reliability of the source of the d ata. For example, the \norganisation may obtain confirmation from the source of the personal data that the \nsource had verified the accuracy and completeness of that personal data. It may also \nconduct f urther independent verification if it deems prudent to do  so. \nExample:  \nNick will be attending an adventure camp for his company\u2019s team -building \npurposes.

Such circumstances include  \ntransferring personal data  to another company within the same group for centralised \ncorporate functions , or to a data intermediary for data processing.  In situations \nwhere personal data transferred or situated overseas remains in the possession or \ncontrol of an organisation, the  organisation has to comply with all the Data  \nProtection Provis ions. Such situations include where an  employee travels overseas \nwith customer lists on his notebook ; an organisation owns  or leases  and operates a \nwarehouse overseas for archival of customer records ; or an organisation stores \npersonal da ta in an overseas data centre on servers that it owns and directly  \nmaintains . In these examples, the organisation has direct primary obligations  under \nthe Data Protection Provisions to, inter alia , protect the personal data, give effect to \naccess and correction requests, an d include these overseas data repositories in its \ndata retention  polic y. \n19.2 This is because t he Transfer Limitation Obligation is a manifestation of the \nAccountability Obligation . Wh en an organisation discloses personal data to another \norganisation, and both are in Singapore, the receiving organisation is subject to the \nPDPA and has to protect the personal data that it thereby receives . Likewise, when \nan organisation discloses persona l data to its data intermediary, and both are in \nSingapore, the data intermed iary is subject to the Protection, Retention Limitation \nand Data Breach Notification Obligations  for the personal data that it thereby \nreceives . However,  when an organisation transfers  personal data to another \norganisation that is outside Singapore (for ex ample,  a data intermediary  or another \ncompany in the same group ), the recipient  organisation is not subject to the PDPA. \nThe Accountability Obligation  requires that the transferring  organisation takes steps \nto ensure that the recipient  organisation will co ntinue to protect the personal data \nthat it has received to a standard that is comparable to that established in PDPA.  This \nis the raison d\u2019etre  for the Transfer Limitat ion Obligation.   \n19.3 Thus , section 26(1) provides that an organisation must not transfer a ny personal data \nto a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements \nprescribed under the PDPA , i.e.  to ensure that organisations provide a standard of \nprotection to transferred personal data that is comparable to the protect ion under \nthe PDPA.

Data int ermediaries that process \nthe personal data o n behalf and for the purposes of another organisation (including \na public agency) are also required to notify that other organisation or public agency \nof a data breach detected.

Any u nreasonable delay in assessing a \ndata breach will be a breach of the DBN Obligation and the Commission  can take \nenforcement action.  \n20.4 While there may be varying circumstances that would affect the time taken to \nestablish the facts of a data b reach and determine whether it is notifiable, \norganisations should generally d o so within 30 calendar days.

This may include situa tions where the organisation can determine the \npurposes for which the personal data is collected, used or disclosed, or the manner \nand means by which the data is processed. This general concept of accountability is \nin Part 3 of the PDPA on \u201cGeneral Rules w ith Respect to Protection of and \nAccountability for Pers onal Data\u201d and premised on  section 11(2) within Part 3 of the \nPDPA, which states, \u201cAn organisation is responsible for personal data in its \npossession or under its control.\u201d . \n21.2 Accountability  under  the P DPA requires organisations to undertake measures in \norder to ensure that they meet their obligations under the PDPA and, importantly, \ndemonstrate that they can do so when required. Some of these measures are \nspeci fically required under the PDPA. F or exampl e, designating  one or more \nindividuals to be respons ible for ensuring the organisation\u2019s compliance with the \nPDPA , developing  and implementing policies and practices that are necessary for the \norganisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA (\u201cdata prot ection policies and \npractices\u201d),  and making informat ion about their data protection policies and \npractices available. Other measures as described at para graph  21.15  are not \nmandatory but are good practices to help org anisations in meeting their obligations \nunder the PDPA.  \nAppointing a Data Protection Officer  \n21.3 Section 11(3) of the PDPA requires an organisation to designate  one or more \nindividuals to be responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with the \nPDPA. This ind ividual is typically referred to as a DPO. Section 11(4) further provides \nthat an individual so designated by an organisation may delegate the responsibility \nconferred by that designation to another individual.  Section 11(6) clarifies that the \ndesignation  of an individual by an organisation under section 11(3) does not relieve \nthe organisation of any of its obligations under the PDPA. That is, legal responsibility  \nfor complying with the PDPA remains with the organisation and is not transferred t o \nthe desig nated individual(s). On the whole, these provisions require organisations to \ndesignate the appropriate individuals, who may in turn delegate certain \nresponsibilities to other officers, so that collectively, they co -operate to ensure that \n \n80 Previously known as the \u201cOpenness Obligation\u201d.

The responsibilities of the DPO often include working \nwith senior management and the organisation\u2019s business unit s to develo p and \nimplement appropriate data protection policies and practices for the organisation . \nIn addition, the DPO would undertake  a wide range of activities, which may include \nproducing (or guiding the production of) a personal data inventory, condu cting data \nprotection impact assessments, monitoring and reporting data protection risks, \nproviding internal training on data protection compliance, engaging with \nstakeholders on data protection matters and generally acting as the primary internal \nexpert o n data prot ection. Depending on the organisation\u2019s needs, the DPO may also \nwork with (or have additional responsibilities relating to) the organisation\u2019s data \ngovernance and cybersecurity functions . The DPO can also play a role in supporting \nan organisatio n\u2019s innovat ion. \n21.5 Individual(s) designated by an organisation under section 11(3) should be: (a) \nsufficiently skilled and knowledgeable; and (b) amply empowered, to discharge their \nduties as a DPO, although they need not be an employee of the organisation. \nOrganisation s should ensure that individuals appointed as a DPO are trained and \ncertified82. The individual(s) should ideally be a member of the organisation\u2019s senior \nmanagement team or have a direct reporting line to the senior management to \nensure the eff ective devel opment and implementation of the organisation\u2019s data \nprotection policies and practices. As part of corporate governance, the commitment \nand involvement of senior management is key to ensure that there is accountability \nand oversight over the ma nagement of personal data in the organisation.  \n21.6 The DPO (or someone working with him) may also be the primary contact point for \nthe organisation\u2019s data protection matters.

This also entails \nensur ing th at policies and practices are easily accessible to the intended reader . \nFurthermore, t he organisation should put in place monitoring mechanisms and \nprocess controls to ensure the effective implementation of these policies and \npractices.  \n21.10  Secondly, an  organis ation must develop a process to receive and respond to \ncomplaints that may arise with respect to the application of the PDPA87. This is to \nensure that the organisation can effectively address individuals\u2019 complaints and \nconcerns with its data protec tion po licies and practices and aid in its overall \ncompliance efforts.  \n21.11  Thirdly, an organisation is required to provide staff training and  communicate to its \nstaff information about its policies and practices88.

They diverge from a single experience to multiple possibilities. When they learn they will ask 'why', and will start from detail to logically work up to the big picture. They like working with others but like things to remain calm \u2013 they will be distressed by conflicts in the group. They like to receive constructive feedback.   CONVERGERS (Abstract conceptualization/Active experimenter) think about things and then try out their ideas to see if they work in practice. When they learn they will ask 'how', and will want to learn by understanding how things work in practice. They like facts and will seek to make things efficient by making small and careful changes. They prefer to work alone or independently.  ACCOMODATORS (Concrete experiencer/Active experimenter) have the most hands-on approach, with a strong preference for doing rather than thinking. When they lean they will ask 'what if?' and 'why not?' to support their action-first approach. They do not like routine and will take creative risks to see what happens. They learn better by themselves than with others.  ASSIMILATORS (Abstract conceptualiser/Reflective observer) have the most cognitive approach, preferring to think than to act. When they learn they will ask 'What is there I can know?' and like organised and structured understanding.  Lectures are their preference, with demonstrations where possible, and will respect the knowledge of experts. People with this style will have a strong control need. They learn best with lectures that start from high-level concepts and work down to the detail.

It is the\nprocess of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an\ninteractive experience.[2] The Octalysis framework is used in healthcare, fitness, education, training,\ncompany, and produc t design to increase user engagement, ROI and motivation.[3][4][5]\nThe Octalysis framework sugge sts that if there are no core drives present,\nthen there is no motivation and no behavior will happen. This is based on\nthe premise that almost all games appeal to certain core drives within us and\nmotivate us towards a variety of decisions and activities. The framework\ndivides these motivations into eight core drives.\nThis Core Drive is in play when a person believes he or she is\ndoing something greater than oneself or was \u201cchosen\u201d to take\naction. An example would be Wikipedia volunteers who maintain\nthe page and contribute to the development of its content.\nContributors do not receive any extrinsic reward, but they feel that\ntheir contribution will help to develop and protect human\nknow ledge. The implementation of this drive can vastly differ, and\nis not limited to altruistic behavior. Some of the world's worst\nevents and actions have happened with the belief of participating in\nsomething gr eater than one self.Eight Core Drives\nCore Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling\nCore Drive 2: Development and\nAccomplishment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d71f9dda-81c9-4548-85e0-9e7ced69b555": {"__data__": {"id_": "d71f9dda-81c9-4548-85e0-9e7ced69b555", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ce500e2-5dd2-4ae8-8666-d125fbe03638", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "00a95f81df06b829fbc9c758ff38861037c88b5ce687f18bc5b1f6228817701a"}}, "hash": "00a95f81df06b829fbc9c758ff38861037c88b5ce687f18bc5b1f6228817701a", "text": "This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth towards a goal and accomplishing it.\nWin-State is often a scenario in which user has overcome a challenge. The perception of the challenge is\nimportant. For example, a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful for a person. This is the\ndrive that most PBLs: Points, Badges, and Leaderboards focus on.\nThis drive is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new\nthings out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but also\nneed to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with\nLegos, playing Minecraft, and making art are intrinsically fun. When properly designed and integrated to\nempower users to be creative; they often become Evergreen Mechanics: a game designer no longe r needs\nto continuous ly add content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. T he brain simply entertains itself.\nThis drive refers to users feeling like they own or control something. When a person feels ownership over\nsomething, they innately want to increase and improve what they own. For example, the human desire to\naccumulate wealth and the overvaluing of objects within one's possession are the result of this drive. People\nmight think their hous e is worth far more than the market is willing to pay for it, not because of any intrinsic\nproperty of the hous e but because they personally ow n it.\nThis drive incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: mentorship, social\nacceptance, companionship, and even competition and envy. When you s ee a friend that is amazing at some\nskill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to attain the same. Think about how we\nnaturally draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to, turning into a spot premium\nmotivator.\nScarcity and impatience is the core drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare,\nexclusive, or immediately unattainable. Many games have Appointment dyna mics or torture breaks within\nthem (come back in 2 hours to get your reward). The fact that people can\u2019t get something right now\nmotivates them to return to check the availability of the produc t.[7]\nUnpredictability is the core drive of constantly being engaged because you don't know  what is going to\nhappen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks\ninto high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary core drive behind gamblingCore Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback\nCore Drive 4: Ownership and Possession\nCore Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness\nCore Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience\nCore Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb0d950b-97b8-4552-83c7-ba8d7e9288ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb0d950b-97b8-4552-83c7-ba8d7e9288ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5eae352-2cb1-4c0c-8991-9408288d687a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "326e50d5043606acf9430c900d247ff4dbe1561729c041db04b09be1da4f33ac"}}, "hash": "326e50d5043606acf9430c900d247ff4dbe1561729c041db04b09be1da4f33ac", "text": "addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the\ncontroversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal presses a lever more frequently when rewards are\nunpredictable than when rewards occur at fixed times.\nLoss and avoidance is the core drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a\nsmall scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behavior. On a larger scale, it could\nbe to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting.\nOpportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this core drive, because people feel if they\ndidn't act immediately, they would lose the oppor tunity to act forever. This is commonly know n as fear of\nmissing out and can often be seen in marketing promotions with limited time periods, or speculative\ninvestments where any de lay may lead to missing out  on a  once-in-a-lifetime oppor tunity.\nEverything we do is based on one or more of the eight core drives. If none  of them is present, there is zero\nmotivation and no action takes place. Additionally, each of these drives have different natures within them.\nSome make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency. Others core drives create urgency, obsession,\nand even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some\nare more long-term intrinsically focused.\nAs a result, the 8 core drives are charted on an octagon not simply for aesthetic purposes, but because the\nplacement determines the nature of the motivation.\nThe left side of the Octalysis chart is commonly associated with logic, analytical thought , and ownership.\nPeople are motivated by extrinsic elements such as rewards, money, goals, milestones, points, badges,\nrecognition. However, once people obtain the goal or get used to it, they no longe r take the desired\nbehavior.\nThe right side of the Octalysis chart relies on intrinsic motivation: creativity, self-expression and social\ndyna mics. You don't need a goal or reward to use your creativity, hangout  with friends, or to feel the\nsuspense of unpredictability. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic core drives is an important task; research\nshows that extrinsic motivation impairs intrinsic motivation. Because once the companies stop offering the\nextrinsic motivator, user motivation will often plummet to a level much lower than when the extrinsic\nmotivator was first introduc ed (the Over-justification Effect).\nKeep in mind that left brain and right brain references are not literal in terms of actual brain geography, but\nmerely a symbolic differentiation be tween two distinct functions of the brain.\nWhite Hat core drives make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. On the Octalysis octagon they are\nrepresented on the top. It involves motivations that engage the user on expressing creativity and\nachievement through mastering of skills, resulting in a higher sense of accomplishments, meaning, and\nempowerment. While they make us feel powerful, fulfilled and satisfied, they don't attain much urgency (\"I\nam going to save the world, but  I need a coffee first\u201d).Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance\nLeft and Right Brain Core Drives\nWhite Hat and Black Hat Core Drives", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a301099-058f-45cd-9336-6f3b0311e8e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a301099-058f-45cd-9336-6f3b0311e8e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25f98e0a-a6d1-4c38-99bc-ee6d81ed32b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Octalysis.pdf", "file_path": "testdata/Octalysis.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "987f156bf728b015700409b06ea8a354cce522e63e2d22c2345dcd8d8e08e237"}}, "hash": "987f156bf728b015700409b06ea8a354cce522e63e2d22c2345dcd8d8e08e237", "text": "Black Hat core drives are located at the bottom of the Octalysis chart.
